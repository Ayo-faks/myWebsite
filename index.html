        <h2>ðŸ“œ Bio</h2>
        <p>
          As an AI engineer, I focus on helping customers design, deploy and scale end-to-end AI solutions in production. I am passionate about improving customer experience and driving business outcomes by leveraging data.        </p>

        <p>
          I am a creator at heart, and it has led me down some memorable paths in life. I have spent a larger chunk of my life in the creative arts industry producing music and shooting music videos for top Nigerian Artists like MI, Ice Prince, K9, CLAYROCKSU, and Kayswitch. 
          I have produced Jingles for Infinix S4, VIVO phones, First Bank and Eco-bank. I co-wrote and produced the award-winning Big brother Naija theme song and project managed notable TV commercials for the likes of 9mobile, and DSTV during my time as a creative agency producer at Zero degrees.        </p>

        <p>
          I love to learn new skills and processes to achieve innovation and uniqueness. My penchant for innovation and experimentation lead me to Artificial Intelligence. The potential of AI fascinated me. It is a special power that can help me make a meaningful impact, solving humanity's toughest problems and leading to a better quality of life.        </p>

        <p> 
            With AI, I have built a conversation AI bot to help solve customer care problems, designed and built an MLOps pipeline, and currently working on building a clinical AI decision support system.   </p>
            
        <p> The world can always be better than what it is currently.
        </p>  

        <p> I watch movies/series, listen to Pop/Rock and Deep house music, and love to spend some solitary time in alternative universes.</p>
